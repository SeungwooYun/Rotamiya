        <h2 className="submenu-title">Exhibition Management</h2>
        <p><strong>Exhibition management</strong> involves planning and organizing exhibitions or trade shows,
            including selecting a venue, coordinating logistics, and managing the display of products or artwork.
            Exhibition management can be a challenging and rewarding career, requiring strong organizational skills,
            attention to detail, and the ability to work under tight deadlines. Exhibition managers may also be
            responsible for marketing the event and working with sponsors and vendors to ensure the success of the exhibition.
            In addition to managing the physical aspects of the exhibition, exhibition managers may also be responsible for
            managing budgets and finances, as well as coordinating with staff and volunteers.</p>
